## What's new

  

* Compatible with OpenEthereum
* Compatible with complex ABIs
* More tools to parse Events Ã  la Web3Js
* Battle tested with Ethereum, Binance Chain and Polygon
* Can interact with old blockchain snapchots, if provided an old block as parameter

  

## Installation

  
Using a RPC node is the prefered solution.

To install gem simply add this line to your application's Gemfile:

  
Using a RPC node is the prefered solution.

To install gem simply add this line to your application's Gemfile:

  

```ruby

gem  'evm_client'

```

  

And then execute:

```shell
bundle
```
  

Or install it yourself as:

  
```
gem install ethereum.rb
```

## Basic Usage

  

You can create contract from solidity source and deploy it to the blockchain, with following code:

  

```ruby

contract  =  EvmClient::Contract.create(file:  "greeter.sol")

address  =  contract.deploy_and_wait("Hello from ethereum.rb!")

```

  

Deployment may take up to couple of minutes. Once deployed you can start interacting with contract, e.g. calling it's methods:

  

```ruby

contract.call.greet  # => "Hello from ethereum.rb!"

```

  

You can see example contract [greeter here](https://github.com/marekkirejczyk/ruby_ethereum_example/blob/master/contracts/greeter.sol).

  

> If contract method name uses camel case you must convert it to snake case when use call: `call.your_method`.


## Smart contracts

  

### Compile multiple contracts at once

  

If you want to complie multiple contracts at once, you can create new instances using newly declared ruby clasess:

  

```ruby

EvmClient::Contract.create(file:  "mycontracts.sol", client:  client)

contract  =  MyContract1.new

contract  =  contract.deploy_and_wait

contract2  =  MyContract2.new

contract2  =  contract.deploy_and_wait

```

  

All names used to name contract in solidity source will translate to name of classes in ruby (camelized).

  

Note: If class of given name exist it will be undefined first to avoid name collision.

  

### Get contract from blockchain

  

The other way to obtain contract instance is get one that already exist in the blockchain. To do so you need a contract name, contract address and ABI definition.

  

```ruby

contract  =  EvmClient::Contract.create(name:  "MyContract", address:  "0x01a4d1A62F01ED966646acBfA8BB0b59960D06dd ", abi:  abi)

```

  

Note that you need to specify contract name, that will be used to define new class in ruby, as it is not a part of ABI definition.

  

Alternatively you can obtain abi definition and name from contract source file:

  

```ruby

contract  =  EvmClient::Contract.create(file:  "MyContract.sol", address:  "0x01a4d1A62F01ED966646acBfA8BB0b59960D06dd ")

```

  

If you want to create new contract, that is not yet deployed from ABI definition you will need also to supply binary code:

  

```ruby

contract  =  EvmClient::Contract.create(name:  "MyContract", abi:  abi, code:  "...")

```

  

### Simple Truffle integration

  

If you use Truffle to build and deploy contracts, you can pick up the Truffle artifacts to initialize

a contract. For example, if you have a MyContract in the Truffle directory at `/my/truffle/project`:

  

```ruby

contract  =  EvmClient::Contract.create(name:  "MyContract", truffle: { paths: [ '/my/truffle/project' ] }, client:  client, address:  '0x01a4d1A62F01ED966646acBfA8BB0b59960D06dd')

```

  

The contract factory will attempt to load the deployed address from the Truffle artifacts if the client's network is present:

  

```ruby

contract  =  EvmClient::Contract.create(name:  "MyContract", truffle: { paths: [ '/my/truffle/project' ] }, client:  client)

```

  

### Interacting with contract

  

Functions defined in a contract are exposed using the following conventions:

  

```ruby

contract.transact.[function_name](params)

contract.transact_and_wait.[function_name](params)

contract.call.[function_name](params)

```

  

**Example Contract in Solidity**

```

contract SimpleRegistry {

event LogRegister(bytes32 key, string value);

mapping (bytes32 => string) public registry;

  

function register(bytes32 key, string value) {

registry[key] = value;

LogRegister(key, value);

}

  

function get(bytes32 key) public constant returns(string) {

return registry[key];

}

  

}

```

  

For contract above here is how to access it's methods:

  

```ruby

contract.transact_and_wait.register("performer", "Beastie Boys")

```

  

Will send transaction to the blockchain and wait for it to be mined.

  

```ruby

contract.transact.register("performer", "Black Eyed Peas")

```

  

Will send transaction to the blockchain return instantly.

  

```ruby

contract.call.get("performer") # => "Black Eyed Peas"

```

  

Will call method of the contract and return result.

Note that no transaction need to be send to the network as method is read-only.

On the other hand `register` method will change contract state, so you need to use `transact` or `transact_and_wait` to call it.

  

### Receiving Contract Events

  Using this example , you can fetch all of the `my_event_name` events:

```ruby
event_name        =  'my_event_name'
event_abi         =  contract.abi.find { |abi|  abi['name'] ==  event_name.camelize }
sig               =  contract.parent.events.find { |e|  e.name.to_s  ==  event_name.camelize }.signature
topics            = [encoder.ensure_prefix(sig)]
from_block_number = 1
from_block        =  "0x#{block_number.to_s(16)}"

response  =  client.eth_get_logs(
  {
    fromBlock:  from_block,
    toBlock:  'latest',
    address:  contract_address,
    topics:  topics
  }
)

raw_events  =  response['result']


raw_events.map  do  |event|
  ::EvmClient::EventLog.build(raw_response:  event, contract:  contract)
end
```

  What is being returned is a collection of `EventLog` containing all of the extracted and decoded data you would need.
  

  

### IPC Client Connection

  

By default methods interacting with contracts will use default Json RPC Client that will handle connection to ethereum node.

Default client communicate via IPC. If you want to create custom client or use multiple clients you can create them yourself.

  

To create IPC client instance of simply create EvmClient::IpcClient:

  

```ruby

client  =  EvmClient::IpcClient.new

```

  

You can also customize it with path to ipc file path and logging flag:

  

```ruby

client  =  EvmClient::IpcClient.new("~/.parity/mycustom.ipc", false)

```

  

If no ipc file path given, IpcClient looks for ipc file in default locations for parity and geth.

The second argument is optional. If it is true then logging is on.

  

By default logging is on and logs are saved in "/tmp/ethereum_ruby_http.log".

  

To create Http client use following:

  

```ruby

client  =  EvmClient::HttpClient.new('http://localhost:8545')

```

  

You can supply client when creating a contract:

  

```ruby

contract  =  EvmClient::Contract.create(client:  client, ...)

```

  

You can also obtain default client:

  

```ruby

client  =  EvmClient::Singleton.instance

```

  

### Calling json rpc methods

  

Ethereum.rb allows you to interact directly with Ethereum node using json rpc api calls.

Api calls translates directly to client methods. E.g. to call `eth_gasPrice` method:

  

```ruby

client.eth_gas_price  # => {"jsonrpc"=>"2.0", "result"=>"0x4a817c800", "id"=>1}

```

  

Note: methods are transated to underscore notation.

  

Full list of json rpc methods is available [here](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC#user-content-json-rpc-methods)

  

### Signed transactions

  

Ethereum.rb supports signing transactions with key using [ruby-eth gem](https://github.com/se3000/ruby-eth).

  

To create a new key simply do the following:

  

```ruby

key  =  Eth::Key.new

```

  

Then you can use the key to deploy contracts and send transactions, i.e.:

  

```ruby

contract  =  EvmClient::Contract.create(file:  "...")

contract.key  =  key

contract.deploy_and_wait("Allo Allo!")

contract.transact_and_wait.set("greeting", "Aloha!")

```

  

You can also transfer ether transfer using custom keys:

  

```ruby

client.transfer(key, "0x342bcf27DCB234FAb8190e53E2d949d7b2C37411", amount)

client.transfer_and_wait(key, "0x949d7b2C37411eFB763fcDCB234FAb8190e53E2d", amount)

```

  
### Custom block

You need a full node which support archived data if you want to set a custom block.
 

```ruby
client.block_number  = 1
```

### Custom gas price and gas limit

  

You can change gas price or gas limit in the client:

  

```ruby

client.gas_limit  =  2_000_000_

client.gas_price  =  24_000_000_000

```

  

or per contract:

```ruby

contract.gas_limit  =  2_000_000_

contract.gas_price  =  24_000_000_000

```

  

### Custom block

  

You can change the block used by the client. Defaulted at `'latest'` if not specified.

If the specified block is older than the latest, transactions are impossible, and only contract `call` are available, as the blockchain is immutable.

  

```ruby

client.block_number  =  12_596_089

```

  
  

## Utils

  

### Url helpers for rails applications

  

Often in the application you want to link to blockchain explorer. This can be problematic if you want links to work with different networks (ropsten, mainnet, kovan) depending on environment you're working on.

Following helpers will generate link according to network connected:

  

```ruby

link_to_tx("See the transaction", "0x3a4e53b01274b0ca9087750d96d8ba7f5b6b27bf93ac65f3174f48174469846d")

link_to_address("See the wallet", "0xE08cdFD4a1b2Ef5c0FC193877EC6A2Bb8f8Eb373")

```

They use [etherscan.io](http://etherscan.io/) as a blockexplorer.

  

Note: Helpers work in rails environment only, works with rails 5.0+.

  

### Utils rake tasks

  

There are couple of rake tasks to help in wallet maintenance, i.e.:

  

```ruby

rake  ethereum:contract:deploy[path] # Compile and deploy contract

rake  ethereum:contract:compile[path] # Compile a contract

rake  ethereum:transaction:byhash[id] # Get info about transaction

rake  ethereum:transaction:send[address,amount] # Send [amount of] ether to an account

```

  

## Debbuging

Logs from communication between ruby app and node are available under following path:

```

/tmp/ethereum_ruby_http.log

```

  

## Roadmap

  

* Rubydoc documentation

  

## Development

  

Run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

  

Make sure `rake ethereum:test:setup` passes before running tests.

  

Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests.

  

Test that do send transactions to blockchain are marked with `blockchain` tag. Good practice is to run first fast tests that use no ether and only if they pass, run slow tests that do spend ether. To do that use the following line:

  

```bash

$ bundle exec rspec --tag ~blockchain && bundle exec rspec --tag blockchain

```

  

You need ethereum node up and running for tests to pass and it needs to be working on testnet (Ropsten).
